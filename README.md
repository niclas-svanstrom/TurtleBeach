A small game i did when i wanted to try out PyGame, you shoot shells from middle of the screen to kill the crabs and seagulls that are attacking the turtles that just want to go to the sea...  
The code is not good structure because this is something i did over one day to test it out  
The sprites are selfmade and maybe the most fun to do ^^
